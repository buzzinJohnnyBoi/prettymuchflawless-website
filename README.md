# Pretty Much Flawless website

This is a website I made for my brother Daniel's YouTube channel

Made with 2 `create-react-app` servers, one in `/edit` and one in `/website`

The `/edit` allows him to add pages, change content, add text, images, or videos, this is only available on the local network.  
The `/website` is the display website you see on prettymuchflawless.com
The `/server` is the API that gets the content to render. 

I also use a Google API to get the Channel's latest YouTube videos.

Self-hosted on one of my HA servers
